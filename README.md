# context-aware-ai-eraser
A privacy-focused computer vision system that automatically detects sensitive content such as faces, license plates, and ID-like regions in images, then allows users to selectively erase them based on context (public or private). Built with a hybrid AI + user-control design for safe, practical, and real-world privacy protection.
